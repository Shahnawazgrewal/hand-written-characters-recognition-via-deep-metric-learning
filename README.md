# Dataset Description
Computer vision community has extensively used MNIST dataset in different applications including similarity. However, the dataset has only few seemingly similar classes, making it less effective for deep metric learning methods. In this paper, a new handwritten dataset named
Urdu-Characters is created in a similar way as MNIST dataset.
